## v1.38.0 (March 13, 2025)

### Added

 - Added the `Nonlinear.SymbolicAD` submodule (#2624), (#2685)

### Fixed

 - Fixed a bug in `Utilities.operate(vcat, ) -> VectorNonlinearFunction` which
   previously did not ensure that the returned function could be mutated (#2682)
 - Fixed `get` for [`ConstraintFunction`](@ref) of
   [`Bridges.Constraint.SplitHyperRectangleBridge`](@ref) to not add spurious
   `+0` and `-0` (#2681)

   reformulations were not recognized as being equivalent (#2686)
 - Fixed [`FileFormats.MOF.Model`](@ref) to use `use_nlp_block = false` by
   default if the model contains [`ScalarNonlinearFunction`](@ref). This change
   could be regarded as technically breaking because writing and reading a model
   with [`ScalarNonlinearFunction`](@ref) used to return a [`NLPBlock`](@ref),
   but now it reads functions as the expected [`ScalarNonlinearFunction`](@ref)
   (#2688)

 - Improved parallelism in the CI tests (#2674)

## v1.37.0 (February 24, 2025)

### Added

 - Added constructors for [`VectorAffineFunction`](@ref) and [`VectorQuadraticFunction`](@ref)
   that accept `AbstractVector{MOI.ScalarAffineFunction}` and

   (#2641), (#2642), (#2644), (#2645), (#2646), (#2647), (#2648), (#2649),
   (#2650)
 - Fixed link to the coverage badge (#2634)
 - Removed the mention of MathProgBase from the README (#2635)
 - Removed `precompile` statements. Packages using MOI should address
   precompilation using `PrecompileTools.jl` in their own package (#2643)
 - Removed unneeded `Unicode` dependency (#2656)

## v1.36.0 (February 12, 2025)

### Fixed

 - Fixed error when adding unsupported constraints to `Utilities.AbstractModel`
   (#2572)
 - Fixed creating [`Interval`](@ref), [`Semicontinuous`](@ref) and [`Semiinteger`](@ref)

### Fixed

 - Fixed [`supports_constraint`](@ref) for `IndicatorSOS1Bridge` (#2507)

 - Fixed `FileFormats.NL` to read linear constraints as
   [`ScalarAffineFunction`](@ref) (#2512)
 - Changed `default_copy_to` to maintain the order of variables during `copy_to`.
   This change is marked as non-breaking, but it may cause different (but
   mathematically equivalent) models to be formulated, particularly conic models
   with bridges. (#2495) (#2520)

## v1.0.0 (February 17, 2022)

Although tagged as a breaking release, v1.0.0 is v0.10.9 with deprecations
removed, similar to how Julia 1.0 was Julia 0.7 with deprecations removed.

### Breaking

 - Julia 1.6 is now the minimum supported version
 - All deprecations have been removed

### Troubleshooting problems when updating

If you experience problems when updating, you are likely using previously
deprecated features. (By default, Julia does not warn when you use
deprecated features.)

To find the deprecated features you are using, start Julia with `--depwarn=yes`:
```
$ julia --depwarn=yes
```
Then install MathOptInterface v0.10.9:
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> pkg"add MathOptInterface@0.10"
```
And then run your code. Apply any suggestions, or search the release notes below
for advice on updating a specific deprecated feature.

## v0.10.9 (February 16, 2022)

### Added

 - Added `MOI.Utilities.FreeVariables` as a new `VariablesConstrainer` for conic
   solvers
 - Added `MOI.default_cache` for specifying the model used in `CachingOptimizer`

### Fixed

 - Fixed LaTeX printing of `MOI.Interval` sets

### Other

 - Added Aqua.jl as a CI check, and fixed suggested issues
 - The constructors of GeoMeanBridge, StructOfConstraints, and CachingOptimizer
   were changed from outer to inner constructors. This change is technically
   breaking, but does not impact users who followed the documented API.

## v0.10.8 (February 3, 2022)

### Added

 - Added a `Base.read!` for `FileFormats.LP`.

### Fixed

 - Fixed a bug in `MutableSparseMatrix`
 - Fixed a bug when calling `operate!(vcat, ...)` with `Number` arguments
 - Removed unintended export of deprecated symbols
 - Fixed a bug with `PowerCone` and `DualPowerCone` in `MatrixOfConstraints`.

## v0.10.7 (January 5, 2022)

### Added

 - Added test for modifying the constant vector in a
   `VectorAffineFunction-in-Zeros` constraint.

### Fixed

 - Fixed the order in which sets are added to a `LazyBridgeOptimizer`. Compared
   to v0.10.6, this may result in bridged models being created with a different
   number (and order) of variables and constraints. However, it was necessary to
   fix cases which were previously rejected as unsupported, even though there
   was a valid bridge transformation.
 - Fixed an error message in `FileFormats.CBF`
 - Fixed comparison in `test_linear_integration_Interval`
 - Fixed errors for `ConstraintPrimal` in a `CachingOptimizer`
 - Fixed printing of models with non-`Float64` coefficients.

### Other

 - Various improvements to reduce time-to-first-solve latency
 - Improved error message when an optimizer does not support `compute_conflict!`

## v0.10.6 (November 30, 2021)

### Added

 - Added new documentation and tests for infeasibility certificates
 - Added a version control system for the tests in `MOI.Test.runtests`. Pass
   `exclude_tests_after = v"0.10.5"` to run tests added in v0.10.5 and earlier.
 - `MOI.Test.runtests` now supports generic number types. To specify the number
   type `T`, pass `MOI.Test.Config(T)`.
 - Added `infeasible_status` to `MOI.Test.Config` for solvers which return
   `LOCALLY_INFEASIBLE`
 - CachingOptimizers now use a fallback for `ConstraintPrimal`. This should
   enable solvers using a CachingOptimizer to pass tests requiring
   `ConstraintPrimal`.

### Fixed

 - Fixed a StackOverflow bug in `copy_to`
 - Fixed error thrown when nonconvex quadratic constraints cannot be bridged
 - Fixed a bug in `copy_to` for `FileFormats.NL.Model`
 - Fixed a bug in `FileFormats.NL` when printing large integers

**MOI v0.10 is a significant breaking release. There are a large number of
user-visible breaking changes and code refactors, as well as a substantial
number of new features.**

### Breaking in MOI

- `SingleVariable` has been removed; use `VariableIndex` instead
- `SingleVariableConstraintNameError` has been renamed to
  `VariableIndexConstraintNameError`
- `SettingSingleVariableFunctionNotAllowed` has been renamed to
  `SettingVariableIndexFunctionNotAllowed`
- `VariableIndex` constraints should not support `ConstraintName`
- `VariableIndex` constraints should not support `ConstraintBasisStatus`;
  implement `VariableBasisStatus` instead
- `ListOfConstraints` has been renamed to `ListOfConstraintTypesPresent`
- `ListOfConstraintTypesPresent` should now return `Tuple{Type,Type}` instead of
  `Tuple{DataType,DataType}`
- `SolveTime` has been renamed to `SolveTimeSec`
- `IndicatorSet` has been renamed to `Indicator`
- `RawParameter` has been renamed to `RawOptimizerAttribute` and now takes
  `String` instead of `Any` as the only argument
- The `.N` field in result attributes has been renamed to `.result_index`
- The `.variable_index` field in `ScalarAffineTerm` has been renamed to
  `.variable`
- The `.variable_index_1` field in `ScalarQuadraticTerm` has been renamed to
  `.variable_1`
- The `.variable_index_2` field in `ScalarQuadraticTerm` has been renamed to
  `.variable_2`
- The order of `affine_terms` and `quadratic_terms` in `ScalarQuadraticFunction`
  and `VectorQuadraticFunction` have been reversed. Both functions now accept
  quadratic, affine, and constant terms in that order.
- The `index_value` function has been removed. Use `.value` instead.
- `isapprox` has been removed for `SOS1` and `SOS2`.
- The `dimension` argument to `Complements(dimension::Int)` should now be the
  length of the corresponding function, instead of half the length. An
  `ArgumentError` is thrown if `dimension` is not even.
- `copy_to` no longer takes keyword arguments:
  - `copy_names`: now copy names if they are supported by the destination solver
  - `filter_constraints`: use `Utilities.ModelFilter` instead
  - `warn_attributes`: never warn about optimizer attributes

### Breaking in `Bridges`

- `Constraint.RSOCBridge` has been renamed to `Constraint.RSOCtoSOCBridge`
- `Constraint.SOCRBridge` has been renamed to `Constraint.SOCtoRSOCBridge`
- Bridges now return vectors that can be modified by the user. Previously, some
  bridges returned views instead of copies.
- `Bridges.IndexInVector` has been unified into a single type. Previously, there
  was a different type for each submodule within `Bridges`
- The signature of indicator bridges has been fixed. Use
  `MOI.Bridges.Constraint.IndicatortoSOS1{Float64}(model)`.

### Breaking in `FileFormats`

- `FileFormats.MOF.Model` no longer accepts `validate` argument. Use the
  JSONSchema package to validate the MOF file. See the documentation for more
  information.

### Breaking in `Utilities`

- The datastructure of `Utilities.Model` (and models created with
  `Utilities.@model`) has been significantly refactored in a breaking way. This
  includes the way that objective functions and variable-related information is
  stored.
- `Utilities.supports_default_copy` has been renamed to
  `supports_incremental_interface`
- `Utilities.automatic_copy_to` has been renamed to `Utilities.default_copy_to`
- The allocate-load API has been removed
- `CachingOptimizer`s are now initialized as `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER` instead of
  `ATTACHED_OPTIMIZER`. If your code relies on the optimizer being attached,
  call `MOIU.attach_optimizer(model)` after creation.
- The field names of `Utilities.IndexMap` have been renamed to `var_map` and
  `con_map`. Accessing these fields directly is considered a private detail that
  may change. Use the public `getindex` and `setindex!` API instead.
- The size argument to `Utilities.CleverDicts.CleverDict(::Integer)` has been
  removed.
- The size argument to `Utilities.IndexMap(::Integer)` has been removed.
- `Utilities.DoubleDicts` have been significantly refactored. Consult the source
  code for details.
- `Utilities.test_models_equal` has been moved to `MOI.Test`

### Breaking in `Test`

- `MOI.Test` has been renamed to `MOI.DeprecatedTest`
- An entirely new `MOI.Test` submodule has been written. See the documentation
  for details. The new `MOI.Test` submodule may find many bugs in the
  implementations of existing solvers that were previously untested.

### Other changes:

- `attribute_value_type` has been added
- `copy_to_and_optimize!` has been added
- `VariableBasisStatus` has been added
- `print(model)` now prints a human-readable description of the model
- Various improvements to the `FileFormats` submodule
  - `FileFormats.CBF` was refactored and received bugfixes
  - Support for MathOptFormat v0.6 was added in `FileFormats.MOF`
  - `FileFormats.MPS` has had bugfixes and support for more features such as
    `OBJSENSE` and objective constants.
  - `FileFormats.NL` has been added to support nonlinear files
- Improved type inference throughout to reduce latency

### Updating

A helpful script when updating is:
```julia
for (root, dirs, files) in walkdir(".")
    for file in files
        if !endswith(file, ".jl")
            continue
        end
        path = joinpath(root, file)
        s = read(path, String)
        for pair in [
            ".variable_index" => ".variable",
            "RawParameter" => "RawOptimizerAttribute",
            "ListOfConstraints" => "ListOfConstraintTypesPresent",
            "TestConfig" => "Config",
            "attr.N" => "attr.result_index",
            "SolveTime" => "SolveTimeSec",
            "DataType" => "Type",
            "Utilities.supports_default_copy_to" =>
                "supports_incremental_interface",
            "SingleVariableConstraintNameError" =>
                "VariableIndexConstraintNameError",
            "SettingSingleVariableFunctionNotAllowed" =>
                "SettingVariableIndexFunctionNotAllowed",
            "automatic_copy_to" => "default_copy_to",
        ]
            s = replace(s, pair)
        end
        write(path, s)
    end
end
```

  `VectorAffineFunction` (#639).
- Use tolerance to compare `VariablePrimal` in `rotatedsoc1` test (#632).
- Use a zero constant in `ScalarAffineFunction` of constraints in `psdt2`
  (#622).

## v0.8.1 (January 7, 2019)

- Adding an NLP objective now overrides any objective set using the
  `ObjectiveFunction` attribute (#619).
- Rename `fullbridgeoptimizer` into `full_bridge_optimizer` (#621).
- Allow custom constraint types with `full_bridge_optimizer` (#617).
- Add `Vectorize` bridge which transforms scalar linear constraints into vector
  linear constraints (#615).

## v0.8.0 (December 18, 2018)

- Rename all enum values to follow the JuMP naming guidelines for constants,
  for example, `Optimal` becomes `OPTIMAL`, and `DualInfeasible` becomes
  `DUAL_INFEASIBLE`.
- Rename CachingOptimizer methods for style compliance.
- Add an `MOI.TerminationStatusCode` called `ALMOST_DUAL_INFEASIBLE`.

## v0.7.0 (December 13, 2018)

  `MOI.optimize!` is called.
- Check `supports_default_copy_to` in tests (#594).
- Key pieces of information like optimality, infeasibility, etc., are now reported
  through `TerminationStatusCode`. It is typically no longer necessary to check the
  result statuses in addition to the termination status.
- Add perspective dimension to log-det cone (#593).

## v0.6.4 (November 27, 2018)

- Add `OptimizeNotCalled` termination status (#577) and improve documentation of
  other statuses (#575).

- Document solver-specific attributes (#580) and implement them in
  `Utilities.CachingOptimizer` (#565).

## v0.6.3 (November 16, 2018)

  thrown only on lookup. This change breaks some existing tests. (#549)
- Attributes may now be partially set (some values could be `nothing`). (#563)
- Performance improvements in Utilities.Model (#549, #567, #568)
- Fix bug in QuadtoSOC (#558).

- Improve hygiene of `@model` macro (#544).
- Fix bug in copy tests (#543).
- Fix bug in UniversalFallback attribute getter (#540).
- Allow all correct solutions for `solve_blank_obj` unit test (#537).
- Add errors for Allocate-Load and bad constraints (#534).
- \[performance\] Add specialized implementation of `hash` for `VariableIndex` (#533).
- \[performance\] Construct the name to object dictionaries lazily in model (#535).
- Add the `QuadtoSOC` bridge which transforms `ScalarQuadraticFunction`
  constraints into `RotatedSecondOrderCone` (#483).

## v0.6.1 (September 22, 2018)

- Enable `PositiveSemidefiniteConeSquare` set and quadratic functions
  in `MOIB.fullbridgeoptimizer` (#524).
- Add warning in the bridge between `PositiveSemidefiniteConeSquare` and
  `PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle` when the matrix is almost symmetric (#522).
- Modify `MOIT.copytest` to not add multiples constraints on the same variable
  (#521).
- Add missing keyword argument in one of `MOIU.add_scalar_constraint` methods
  (#520).

## v0.6.0 (August 30, 2018)

- The `MOIU.@model` and `MOIB.@bridge` macros now support functions and sets
  defined in external modules. As a consequence, function and set names in the
  macro arguments need to be prefixed by module name.
- Rename functions according to the [JuMP style guide](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/developers/style/):
  * `copy!` with keyword arguments `copynames` and `warnattributes` ->
    `copy_to` with keyword arguments `copy_names` and `warn_attributes`;
  * `set!` -> `set`;
  * `addvariable[s]!` -> `add_variable[s]`;
  * `supportsconstraint` -> `supports_constraint`;
  * `addconstraint[s]!` -> `add_constraint[s]`;
  * `isvalid` -> `is_valid`;
  * `isempty` -> `is_empty`;
  * `Base.delete!` -> `delete`;
  * `modify!` -> `modify`;
  * `transform!` -> `transform`;
  * `initialize!` -> `initialize`;
  * `write` -> `write_to_file`; and
  * `read!` -> `read_from_file`.
- Remove `free!` (use `Base.finalize` instead).
- Add the `SquarePSD` bridge which transforms `PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle`
  constraints into `PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle`.
- Add result fallback for `ConstraintDual` of variable-wise constraint,
  `ConstraintPrimal` and `ObjectiveValue`.
- Add tests for `ObjectiveBound`.
- Add test for empty rows in vector linear constraint.
- Rework errors: `CannotError` has been renamed `NotAllowedError` and
  the distinction between `UnsupportedError` and `NotAllowedError` is now
  about whether the element is not supported (for example, it cannot be copied a
  model containing this element) or the operation is not allowed (either
  because it is not implemented, because it cannot be performed in the current
  state of the model, or because it cannot be performed for a specific index)
- `canget` is removed. `NoSolution` is added as a result status to indicate
  that the solver does not have either a primal or dual solution available
  (See #479).

## v0.5.0 (August 5, 2018)

- Fix names with CachingOptimizer.
- Cleanup thanks to @mohamed82008.
- Added a universal fallback for constraints.
- Fast utilities for function canonicalization thanks to @rdeits.
- Renamed `dimension` field to `side_dimension` in the context of matrix-like
  sets.
- New and improved tests for cases like duplicate terms and `ObjectiveBound`.
- Removed `cantransform`, `canaddconstraint`, `canaddvariable`, `canset`,
  `canmodify`, and `candelete` functions from the API. They are replaced by a
  new set of errors that are thrown: Subtypes of `UnsupportedError` indicate
  unsupported operations, while subtypes of `CannotError` indicate operations
  that cannot be performed in the current state.
 - The API for `copy!` is updated to remove the CopyResult type.
 - Updates for the new JuMP style guide.
