# Latency

MathOptInterface suffers the "time-to-first-solve" problem of start-up latency.

This hurts both the user- and developer-experience of MathOptInterface. In the
first case, because simple models have a multi-second delay before solving, and
in the latter, because our tests take so long to run!

This page contains some advice on profiling and fixing latency-related problems
in the MathOptInterface.jl repository.

## Background

Before reading this part of the documentation, you should familiarize yourself
with the reasons for latency in Julia and how to fix them.

 * Read the blogposts on julialang.org on [precompilation](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/precompile_tutorial/)
   and [SnoopCompile](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/snoopi_deep/)
 * Read the [SnoopCompile](https://timholy.github.io/SnoopCompile.jl/stable/)
   documentation.

## Causes

There are three main causes of latency in MathOptInterface:

 1. A large number of types
 2. Lack of method ownership
 3. Type-instability in the bridge layer

### A large number of types

Julia is very good at specializing method calls based on the input type. Each
specialization has a compilation cost, but the benefit of faster run-time
performance.

The best-case scenario is for a method to be called a large number of times with
a single set of argument types. The worst-case scenario is for a method to be
called a single time for a large set of argument types.

Because of MathOptInterface's _function-in-set_ formulation, we fall into the
worst-case situation.

This is a fundamental limitation of Julia, so there isn't much we can do about
it. However, if we can precompile MathOptInterface, much of the cost can be
shifted from start-up latency to the time it takes to precompile a package on
installation.

However, there are two things which make MathOptInterface hard to precompile...

### Lack of method ownership

Lack of method ownership happens when a call is made using a mix of structs and
methods from different modules. Because of this, no single module "owns" the
method that is being dispatched, and so it cannot be precompiled.

!!! tip
    This is a slightly simplified explanation. Read the [precompilation tutorial](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/precompile_tutorial/)
    for a more in-depth discussion on back-edges.

Unfortunately, the design of MOI means that this is a frequent occurrence! We
have a bunch of types in `MOI.Utilities` that wrap types defined in external
packages (i.e., the `Optimizer`s), which implement methods of functions defined
in `MOI` (e.g., `add_variable`, `add_constraint`).

Here's a simple example of method-ownership in practice:
```julia
module MyMOI
struct Wrapper{T}
    inner::T
end
optimize!(x::Wrapper) = optimize!(x.inner)
end  # MyMOI

module MyOptimizer
using ..MyMOI
struct Optimizer end
MyMOI.optimize!(x::Optimizer) = 1
end  # MyOptimizer

using SnoopCompile
model = MyMOI.Wrapper(MyOptimizer.Optimizer())

julia> tinf = @snoopi_deep MyMOI.optimize!(model)
InferenceTimingNode: 0.008256/0.008543 on InferenceFrameInfo for Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT() with 1 direct children
```
The result is that there was one method that required type inference. If we
visualize `tinf`:
```julia
using ProfileView
ProfileView.view(flamegraph(tinf))
```
we see a flamegraph with a large red-bar indicating that the method
`MyMOI.optimize(MyMOI.Wrapper{MyOptimizer.Optimizer})` cannot be precompiled.

To fix this, we need to designate a module to "own" that method (i.e., create a
back-edge). The easiest way to do this is for `MyOptimizer` to call
`MyMOI.optimize(MyMOI.Wrapper{MyOptimizer.Optimizer})` during
`using MyOptimizer`. Let's see that in practice:
```julia
module MyMOI
struct Wrapper{T}
    inner::T
end
optimize(x::Wrapper) = optimize(x.inner)
end  # MyMOI

module MyOptimizer
using ..MyMOI
struct Optimizer end
MyMOI.optimize(x::Optimizer) = 1
# The syntax of this let-while loop is very particular:
#  * `let ... end` keeps everything local to avoid polluting the MyOptimizer
#    namespace
#  * `while true ... break end` runs the code once, and forces Julia to compile
#    the inner loop, rather than interpret it.
let
    while true
        model = MyMOI.Wrapper(Optimizer())
        MyMOI.optimize(model)
        break
    end
end
end  # MyOptimizer

using SnoopCompile
model = MyMOI.Wrapper(MyOptimizer.Optimizer())

julia> tinf = @snoopi_deep MyMOI.optimize(model)
InferenceTimingNode: 0.006822/0.006822 on InferenceFrameInfo for Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT() with 0 direct children
```
There are now `0` direct children that required type inference because the
method was already stored in `MyOptimizer`!

Unfortunately, this trick only works if the call-chain is fully inferrable. If
there are breaks (due to type instability), then the benefit of doing this is
reduced. And unfortunately for us, the design of MathOptInterface has a lot of
type instabilities...

### Type instability in the bridge layer

Most of MathOptInterface is pretty good at ensuring type-stability. However, a
key component is not type stable, and that is the bridging layer.

In particular, the bridging layer defines [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref),
which has fields like:
```julia
struct LazyBridgeOptimizer
    constraint_bridge_types::Vector{Any}
    constraint_node::Dict{Tuple{Type,Type},ConstraintNode}
    constraint_types::Vector{Tuple{Type,Type}}
end
```
This is because the `LazyBridgeOptimizer` needs to be able to deal with any
_function-in-set_ type passed to it, and we also allow users to pass additional
bridges that they defined in external packages.

So to recap, MathOptInterface suffers package latency because:

 1. there are a large number of types and functions...
 2. and these are split between multiple modules, including external packages...
 3. and there are type-instabilities like those in the bridging layer.

## Resolutions

There are no magic solutions to reduce latency.
[Issue #1313](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/issues/1313)
tracks progress on reducing latency in MathOptInterface.

A useful script is the following (replace GLPK as needed):
```julia
using MathOptInterface, GLPK
const MOI = MathOptInterface

function example_diet(optimizer, bridge)
    category_data = [
        1800.0 2200.0;
          91.0    Inf;
           0.0   65.0;
           0.0 1779.0
    ]
    cost = [2.49, 2.89, 1.50, 1.89, 2.09, 1.99, 2.49, 0.89, 1.59]
    food_data = [
        410 24 26 730;
        420 32 10 1190;
        560 20 32 1800;
        380  4 19 270;
        320 12 10 930;
        320 15 12 820;
        320 31 12 1230;
        100  8 2.5 125;
        330  8 10 180
    ]
    bridge_model = if bridge
        MOI.instantiate(optimizer; with_bridge_type=Float64)
    else
        MOI.instantiate(optimizer)
    end
    model = MOI.Utilities.CachingOptimizer(
        MOI.Utilities.UniversalFallback(MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()),
        MOI.Utilities.AUTOMATIC,
    )
    MOI.Utilities.reset_optimizer(model, bridge_model)
    MOI.set(model, MOI.Silent(), true)
    nutrition = MOI.add_variables(model, size(category_data, 1))
    for (i, v) in enumerate(nutrition)
        MOI.add_constraint(model, v, MOI.GreaterThan(category_data[i, 1]))
        MOI.add_constraint(model, v, MOI.LessThan(category_data[i, 2]))
    end
    buy = MOI.add_variables(model, size(food_data, 1))
    MOI.add_constraint.(model, buy, MOI.GreaterThan(0.0))
    MOI.set(model, MOI.ObjectiveSense(), MOI.MIN_SENSE)
    f = MOI.ScalarAffineFunction(MOI.ScalarAffineTerm.(cost, buy), 0.0)
    MOI.set(model, MOI.ObjectiveFunction{typeof(f)}(), f)
    for (j, n) in enumerate(nutrition)
        f = MOI.ScalarAffineFunction(
            MOI.ScalarAffineTerm.(food_data[:, j], buy),
            0.0,
        )
        push!(f.terms, MOI.ScalarAffineTerm(-1.0, n))
        MOI.add_constraint(model, f, MOI.EqualTo(0.0))
    end
    MOI.optimize!(model)
    term_status = MOI.get(model, MOI.TerminationStatus())
    @assert term_status == MOI.OPTIMAL
    MOI.add_constraint(
        model,
        MOI.ScalarAffineFunction(
            MOI.ScalarAffineTerm.(1.0, [buy[end-1], buy[end]]),
            0.0,
        ),
        MOI.LessThan(6.0),
    )
    MOI.optimize!(model)
    @assert MOI.get(model, MOI.TerminationStatus()) == MOI.INFEASIBLE
    return
end

if length(ARGS) > 0
    bridge = get(ARGS, 2, "") != "--no-bridge"
    println("Running: $(ARGS[1]) $(get(ARGS, 2, ""))")
    @time example_diet(GLPK.Optimizer, bridge)
    @time example_diet(GLPK.Optimizer, bridge)
    exit(0)
end
```

You can create a flame-graph via
```julia
using SnoopComile
tinf = @snoopi_deep example_diet(GLPK.Optimizer, true)
using ProfileView
ProfileView.view(flamegraph(tinf))
```

Here's how things looked in mid-August 2021:
![flamegraph](../assets/latency.png)

There are a few opportunities for improvement (non-red flames, particularly on
the right). But the main problem is a large red (non-precompilable due to method
ownership) flame.
