# The Bridges submodule

The `Bridges` module simplifies the process of converting models between
equivalent formulations.

!!! tip
    [Read our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03447) for more details on how
    bridges are implemented.

## Why bridges?

A constraint can often be written in a number of equivalent formulations. For
example, the constraint ``l \le a^\top x \le u``
([`ScalarAffineFunction`](@ref)-in-[`Interval`](@ref)) could be re-formulated as
two constraints: ``a^\top x \ge l`` ([`ScalarAffineFunction`](@ref)-in-[`GreaterThan`](@ref))
and ``a^\top x \le u`` (`ScalarAffineFunction`-in-`LessThan`). An alternative
re-formulation is to add a dummy variable `y` with the constraints ``l \le y \le u``
([`SingleVariable`](@ref)-in-[`Interval`](@ref)) and ``a^\top x - y = 0``
([`ScalarAffineFunction`](@ref)-in-[`EqualTo`](@ref)).

To avoid each solver having to code these transformations manually,
MathOptInterface provides *bridges*.

A bridge is a small transformation from one constraint type to another
(potentially collection of) constraint type.

Because these bridges are included in MathOptInterface, they can be re-used by
any optimizer. Some bridges also implement constraint modifications and
constraint primal and dual translations.

## The three types of bridges

There are three types of bridges in MathOptInterface:
1. Constraint bridges
2. Variable bridges
3. Objective bridges

### Constraint bridges

Constraint bridges convert constraints formulated by the user into an equivalent
form supported by the solver.

The equivalent formulation may add constraints (and possibly also variables) in
the underlying model.

Read the [list of implemented constraint bridges](@ref constraint_bridges_ref)
for more details on the types of transformations that are available.

### [Variable bridges](@id variable_bridges)

Variable bridges convert variables added by the user, either free with
[`add_variable`](@ref)/[`add_variables`](@ref), or constrained with
[`add_constrained_variable`](@ref)/[`add_constrained_variables`](@ref),
into an equivalent form supported by the solver.

Te equivalent formulation may add constraints (and possibly also variables) in
the underlying model.

Read the [list of implemented variable bridges](@ref variable_bridges_ref) for
more details on the types of transformations that are available.

### Objective bridges

Objective bridges convert the [`ObjectiveFunction`](@ref) set by the user into
an equivalent form supported by the solver.

Te equivalent formulation may add constraints (and possibly also variables) in
the underlying model.

Read the [list of implemented objective bridges](@ref objective_bridges_ref) for
more details on the types of transformations that are available.

## Bridges.`full_bridge_optimizer`

!!! tip
    Unless you have an advanced use-case, this is probably the only function you
    need to care about.

To enable the full power of MathOptInterface's bridges, wrap an `optimizer`
in a [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> inner_optimizer = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}

julia> optimizer = MOI.Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer(inner_optimizer, Float64)
MOIB.LazyBridgeOptimizer{MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}}
with 0 variable bridges
with 0 constraint bridges
with 0 objective bridges
with inner model MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}
```

That's all you have to do! Use `optimizer` as normal, and bridging will happen
lazily behind the scenes. By lazily, we mean that bridging will only happen if
the constraint is not supported by the `inner_optimizer`.

!!! info
    Most bridges are added by default in [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref).
    However, for technical reasons, some bridges are not added by default. Three
    examples include [`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoPSDBridge`](@ref),
    [`Bridges.Constraint.SOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref) and
    [`Bridges.Constraint.RSOCtoNonConvexQuadBridge`](@ref). See the docs of
    those bridges for more information.

## Add a single bridge

If you don't want to use [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref), you can wrap
an optimizer in a single bridge.

However, this will force the constraint to be bridged, even if the
`inner_optimizer` supports it.

```jldoctest
julia> inner_optimizer = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}

julia> optimizer = MOI.Bridges.Constraint.SplitInterval{Float64}(inner_optimizer)
MOIB.Constraint.SingleBridgeOptimizer{MOIB.Constraint.SplitIntervalBridge{Float64,F,S,LS,US} where US<:MOI.AbstractSet where LS<:MOI.AbstractSet where S<:MOI.AbstractSet where F<:MOI.AbstractFunction,MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}}
with 0 constraint bridges
with inner model MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}

julia> x = MOI.add_variable(optimizer)
MOI.VariableIndex(1)

julia> MOI.add_constraint(optimizer, MOI.SingleVariable(x), MOI.Interval(0.0, 1.0))
MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.SingleVariable,MathOptInterface.Interval{Float64}}(1)

julia> MOI.get(optimizer, MOI.ListOfConstraintTypesPresent())
1-element Array{Tuple{Type,Type},1}:
 (MathOptInterface.SingleVariable, MathOptInterface.Interval{Float64})

julia> MOI.get(inner_optimizer, MOI.ListOfConstraintTypesPresent())
2-element Array{Tuple{Type,Type},1}:
 (MathOptInterface.SingleVariable, MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64})
 (MathOptInterface.SingleVariable, MathOptInterface.LessThan{Float64})
```

## Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer

If you don't want to use [`Bridges.full_bridge_optimizer`](@ref), but you need
more than a single bridge (or you want the bridging to happen lazily), you can
manually construct a [`Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer`](@ref).

First, wrap an inner optimizer:
```jldoctest lazy_bridge_optimizer
julia> inner_optimizer = MOI.Utilities.Model{Float64}()
MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}

julia> optimizer = MOI.Bridges.LazyBridgeOptimizer(inner_optimizer)
MOIB.LazyBridgeOptimizer{MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}}
with 0 variable bridges
with 0 constraint bridges
with 0 objective bridges
with inner model MOIU.GenericModel{Float64,MOIU.ModelFunctionConstraints{Float64}}
```

Then use [`Bridges.add_bridge`](@ref) to add individual bridges:
```jldoctest lazy_bridge_optimizer
julia> MOI.Bridges.add_bridge(optimizer, MOI.Bridges.Constraint.SplitIntervalBridge{Float64})

julia> MOI.Bridges.add_bridge(optimizer, MOI.Bridges.Objective.FunctionizeBridge{Float64})
```

Now the constraints will be bridged only if needed:
```jldoctest lazy_bridge_optimizer
julia> x = MOI.add_variable(optimizer)
MOI.VariableIndex(1)

julia> MOI.add_constraint(optimizer, MOI.SingleVariable(x), MOI.Interval(0.0, 1.0))
MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.SingleVariable,MathOptInterface.Interval{Float64}}(1)

julia> MOI.get(optimizer, MOI.ListOfConstraintTypesPresent())
1-element Array{Tuple{Type,Type},1}:
 (MathOptInterface.SingleVariable, MathOptInterface.Interval{Float64})

julia> MOI.get(inner_optimizer, MOI.ListOfConstraintTypesPresent())
1-element Array{Tuple{Type,Type},1}:
 (MathOptInterface.SingleVariable, MathOptInterface.Interval{Float64})
```
