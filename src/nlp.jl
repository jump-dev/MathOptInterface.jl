A `struct` encoding a set of nonlinear constraints of the form ``lb \\le g(x)
\\le ub`` and, if `has_objective == true`, a nonlinear objective function
``f(x)``. `constraint_bounds` holds the pairs of ``lb`` and ``ub`` elements.
Nonlinear objectives *override* any objective set by using the
`ObjectiveFunction` attribute. The `evaluator` is a callback object that is used
to query function values, derivatives, and expression graphs. If
`has_objective == false`, then it is an error to query properties of
the objective function, and in Hessian-of-the-Lagrangian queries, `σ` must be
set to zero.

!!! note
    Throughout the evaluator, all variables are ordered according to
    [`ListOfVariableIndices`](@ref). Hence, MOI copies of nonlinear problems should be
    done with attention.

    objective_expr(d::AbstractNLPEvaluator)

Returns an expression graph for the objective function as a standard Julia `Expr`
object. All sums and products are flattened out as simple `Expr(:+,...)` and
`Expr(:*,...)` objects. The symbol `x` is used as a placeholder for the
vector of decision variables. No other undefined symbols are permitted;
coefficients are embedded as explicit values. For example, the expression
``x_1+\\sin(x_2/\\exp(x_3))`` would be represented as the Julia object
`:(x[1] + sin(x[2]/exp(x[3])))`. Each integer index is wrapped in a [`VariableIndex`](@ref).
See the [Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.6/manual/metaprogramming/)
for more information on the structure of `Expr` objects.
There are currently no restrictions on recognized functions; typically these
will be built-in Julia functions like `^`, `exp`, `log`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`,
etc., but modeling interfaces may choose to extend these basic functions.

Returns an expression graph for the ``i\\text{th}`` constraint in the same
format as described above, with an additional comparison operator indicating
the sense of and bounds on the constraint. The right-hand side of the comparison
must be a constant; that is, `:(x[1]^3 <= 1)` is allowed, while
`:(1 <= x[1]^3)` is not valid. Double-sided constraints are allowed, in which
case both the lower bound and upper bounds should be constants; for example,
`:(-1 <= cos(x[1]) + sin(x[2]) <= 1)` is valid.
