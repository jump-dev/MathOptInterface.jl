## Example

Suppose that a solver supports only two kind of variables: binary variables
and continuous variables with a lower bound. If the solver decides not to
support `SingleVariable`-in-`Binary` and `SingleVariable`-in-`GreaterThan`
constraints, it only has to implement `add_constrained_variable` for these
two sets which prevents the user to add both a binary constraint and a
lower bound on the same variable. Moreover, if the user adds a
`SingleVariable`-in-`GreaterThan` constraint, implementing this interface (i.e.,
`supports_add_constrained_variables`) enables the constraint to be transparently
bridged into a supported constraint.

By default, if `S` is `Reals` then this function returns `true` and otherwise,
it falls back to `supports_add_constrained_variables(model, Reals) &&

definition for most models.

## Example

In the standard conic form (see [Duality](@ref)), the variables are grouped into
several cones and the constraints are affine equality constraints.
If `Reals` is not one of the cones supported by the solvers then it needs
to implement `supports_add_constrained_variables(::Optimizer, ::Type{Reals}) = false`
as free variables are not supported.
The solvers should then implement
`supports_add_constrained_variables(::Optimizer, ::Type{<:SupportedCones}) = true`
where `SupportedCones` is the union of all cone types that are supported;
it does not have to implement the method
`supports_constraint(::Type{VectorOfVariables}, Type{<:SupportedCones})`
as it should return `false` and it's the default.
This prevents the user to constrain the same variable in two different cones.
When a `VectorOfVariables`-in-`S` is added, the variables of the vector
have already been created so they already belong to given cones.
If bridges are enabled, the constraint will therefore be bridged by adding slack
variables in `S` and equality constraints ensuring that the slack variables are
equal to the corresponding variables of the given constraint function.

Note that there may also be sets for which
`!supports_add_constrained_variables(model, S)` and
`supports_constraint(model, MOI.VectorOfVariables, S)`.
For instance, suppose a solver supports positive semidefinite variable
constraints and two types of variables: binary variables and nonnegative
variables. Then the solver should support adding
`VectorOfVariables`-in-`PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle` constraints, but it
should not support creating variables constrained to belong to the
`PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle` because the variables in
`PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle` should first be created as either binary or
non-negative.
