You should write functions that are generic and not limited to the five types listed above. Thus, you should probably define a fallback filter(::Any) = true.\n\nSee below for examples of how this works.\n\nnote: Note\nThis layer has a limited scope. It is intended by be used in conjunction with MOI.copy_to.\n\nExample: copy model excluding integer constraints\n\nUse the do syntax to provide a single function.\n\nfiltered_src = MOI.Utilities.ModelFilter(src) do item\n    return item != (MOI.VariableIndex, MOI.Integer)\nend\nMOI.copy_to(dest, filtered_src)\n\nExample: copy model excluding names\n\nUse type dispatch to simplify the implementation:\n\nmy_filter(::Any) = true  # Note the generic fallback!\nmy_filter(::MOI.VariableName) = false\nmy_filter(::MOI.ConstraintName) = false\nfiltered_src = MOI.Utilities.ModelFilter(my_filter, src)\nMOI.copy_to(dest, filtered_src)\n\nExample: copy irreducible infeasible subsystem\n\nmy_filter(::Any) = true  # Note the generic fallback!\nfunction my_filter(ci::MOI.ConstraintIndex)\n    status = MOI.get(dest, MOI.ConstraintConflictStatus(), ci)\n    return status != MOI.NOT_IN_CONFLICT\nend\nfiltered_src = MOI.Utilities.ModelFilter(my_filter, src)\nMOI.copy_to(dest, filtered_src)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/#MatrixOfConstraints","page":"API Reference","title":"MatrixOfConstraints","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"Utilities.MatrixOfConstraints","category":"page"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/#MathOptInterface.Utilities.MatrixOfConstraints","page":"API Reference","title":"MathOptInterface.Utilities.MatrixOfConstraints","text":"mutable struct MatrixOfConstraints{T,AT,BT,ST} <: MOI.ModelLike\n    coefficients::AT\n    constants::BT\n    sets::ST\n    caches::Vector{Any}\n    are_indices_mapped::Vector{BitSet}\n    final_touch::Bool\nend\n\nRepresent ScalarAffineFunction and VectorAffinefunction constraints in a matrix form where the linear coefficients of the functions are stored in the coefficients field, the constants of the functions or sets are stored in the constants field. Additional information about the sets are stored in the sets field.\n\nThis model can only be used as the constraints field of a MOI.Utilities.AbstractModel.\n\nWhen the constraints are added, they are stored in the caches field. They are only loaded in the coefficients and constants fields once MOI.Utilities.final_touch is called. For this reason, MatrixOfConstraints should not be used by an incremental interface. Use MOI.copy_to instead.\n\nThe constraints can be added in two different ways:\n\nWith add_constraint, in which case a canonicalized copy of the function is stored in caches.\nWith pass_nonvariable_constraints, in which case the functions and sets are stored themselves in caches without mapping the variable indices. The corresponding index in caches is added in are_indices_mapped. This avoids doing a copy of the function in case the getter of CanonicalConstraintFunction does not make a copy for the source model, e.g., this is the case of VectorOfConstraints.\n\nWe illustrate this with an example. Suppose a model is copied from a src::MOI.Utilities.Model to a bridged model with a MatrixOfConstraints. For all the types that are not bridged, the constraints will be copied with pass_nonvariable_constraints. Hence the functions stored in caches are exactly the same as the ones stored in src. This is ok since this is only during the copy_to operation during which src cannot be modified. On the other hand, for the types that are bridged, the functions added may contain duplicates even if the functions did not contain duplicates in src so duplicates are removed with MOI.Utilities.canonical.\n\nInterface\n\nThe .coefficients::AT type must implement:\n\nAT()\nMOI.empty(::AT)!\nMOI.Utilities.add_column\nMOI.Utilities.set_number_of_rows\nMOI.Utilities.allocate_terms\nMOI.Utilities.load_terms\nMOI.Utilities.final_touch\n\nThe .constants::BT type must implement:\n\nBT()\nBase.empty!(::BT)\nBase.resize(::BT)\nMOI.Utilities.load_constants\nMOI.Utilities.function_constants\nMOI.Utilities.set_from_constants\n\nThe .sets::ST type must implement:\n\nST()\nMOI.is_empty(::ST)\nMOI.empty(::ST)\nMOI.dimension(::ST)\nMOI.is_valid(::ST, ::MOI.ConstraintIndex)\nMOI.get(::ST, ::MOI.ListOfConstraintTypesPresent)\nMOI.get(::ST, ::MOI.NumberOfConstraints)\nMOI.get(::ST, ::MOI.ListOfConstraintIndices)\nMOI.Utilities.set_types\nMOI.Utilities.set_index\nMOI.Utilities.add_set\nMOI.Utilities.rows\nMOI.Utilities.final_touch\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/#.coefficients","page":"API Reference","title":".coefficients","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/","page":"API Reference","title":"API Reference","text":"Utilities.add_column\nUtilities.allocate_terms\nUtilities.set_number_of_rows\nUtilities.load_terms\nUtilities.final_touch\nUtilities.extract_function","category":"page"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/#MathOptInterface.Utilities.add_column","page":"API Reference","title":"MathOptInterface.Utilities.add_column","text":"add_column(coefficients)::Nothing\n\nTell coefficients to pre-allocate datastructures as needed to store one column.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"submodules/Utilities/reference/#MathOptInterface.Utilities.allocate_terms","page":"API Reference","title":"MathOptInterface.Utilities.allocate_terms","text":"allocate_terms(coefficients, index_map, func)::Nothing\n\nTell coefficients that the terms of the function func where the variable indices are mapped with index_map will be loaded with load_terms.\n\nThe function func must be canonicalized before calling allocate_terms.

If Reals is not one of the cones supported by the solvers then it needs to implement supports_add_constrained_variables(::Optimizer, ::Type{Reals}) = false as free variables are not supported. The solvers should then implement supports_add_constrained_variables(::Optimizer, ::Type{<:SupportedCones}) = true where SupportedCones is the union of all cone types that are supported; it does not have to implement the method supports_constraint(::Type{VectorOfVariables}, Type{<:SupportedCones}) as it should return false and it's the default. This prevents the user to constrain the same variable in two different cones. When a VectorOfVariables-in-S is added, the variables of the vector have already been created so they already belong to given cones.

For instance, suppose a solver supports positive semidefinite variable constraints and two types of variables: binary variables and nonnegative variables. Then the solver should support adding VectorOfVariables-in-PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle constraints, but it should not support creating variables constrained to belong to the PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle because the variables in PositiveSemidefiniteConeTriangle should first be created as either binary or non-negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/variables/#MathOptInterface.is_valid-Tuple{MathOptInterface.ModelLike, MathOptInterface.VariableIndex}","page":"Variables","title":"MathOptInterface.is_valid","text":"is_valid(model::ModelLike, index::Index)::Bool\n\nReturn a Bool indicating whether this index refers to a valid object in the model model.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/variables/#MathOptInterface.delete-Tuple{MathOptInterface.ModelLike, MathOptInterface.VariableIndex}","page":"Variables","title":"MathOptInterface.delete","text":"delete(model::ModelLike, index::Index)\n\nDelete the referenced object from the model.
